# **Step 8: Celebrate! You Now Have Built a Supercomputer!**

Congratulations — you’ve just walked through the conceptual journey of building a supercomputer!

You started with:
- A single computer and its parts,
- Brought it to life with BIOS and an operating system,
- Installed tools,
- Expanded with remote storage and remote computing,
- And finally, **connected many computers into a coordinated, powerful infrastructure**.

You now understand the **fundamentals of computational research infrastructure** — and the role it plays in modern science.

## **What Comes Next?**

While building the hardware is important, **building understanding is even more powerful**. As a researcher or research supporter, your next steps could include:

### Learn how to *use* supercomputers:
- Connect to login nodes with `ssh`,
- Submit jobs with Slurm,
- Use modules to load software,
- Explore user guides from national computing centers (e.g., CSC, SURF, NeIC).

### Learn about reproducible environments:
- Use containers (Docker, Singularity),
- Practice setting up workflows with Snakemake or Nextflow,
- Document tools and versions for long-term reproducibility.

### Learn about responsible use:
- Understand the legal and ethical frameworks (e.g., GDPR, data classification),
- Know when personal or sensitive data **can or cannot** be processed remotely,
- Get familiar with data access policies, security settings, and logging tools.

### Support researchers:
- Help them write better data management plans,
- Translate their research needs into technical requirements,
- Connect them with IT and infrastructure services.

You’ve built your own kitchen, learned to borrow others, and now you’re part of a shared cooking facility where world-class science happens.  
You're not just a user of tools — you help **design kitchens**, **organize workflows**, and **support researchers** in creating sustainable, powerful recipes for discovery.

## Remember: you are never alone
High-performance computing is a diverse community of people with various expertise who are very happy to discuss research data analysis workflows and decide together which tool is the most suitable for which case. It can be useful to also learn []"how to ask for help with (super)computers"](https://zenodo.org/records/8392763).
